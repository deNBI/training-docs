<h2>How can you tackle the no-show problem?</h2>

- Two reminders are better than one
- Adding calendar invites to “final information” are also quite helpful
- Small fee (e.g. 50-100€)

<h2>How do you split up during a course?</h2>

- Don’t teach alone
- One for Teaching
- One for chat
- Optional: One for Breakouts 

<h2>How do I deal with waiting lists?</h2>

- For more theoretical online courses (due to a higher no-show rate) you can approve all registered participants, even those on the waiting list
- For F2F this looks different

<h2>How many participants should I admit to online training courses?</h2>

- Depends on the course format, e.g.
- For more theoretical online courses (due to a higher no-show rate) you can approve all registered participants
- For coding courses, especially on beginner, you can have a suitable trainer-trainee ratio, e.g. 4-5 participants per trainer 

<h2>What do I do if there are significantly fewer participants and my tasks are designed for this?</h2>

- In general, this is an advantage. Less participants = more time per participant
- In group work, you can reduce the persons per group  

<h2>What do I do if the participants misbehave?</h2>

- Use a code of conduct for your course
- Present it directly in the beginning of the course
- Use allies that try to solve this problems 

<h2>How can I facilitate communication in this group?</h2>

- Slack = Lifesciencetrainers.org
- FAQ based on the Questions and answers

<h2>How to improve the engagement of online participants?</h2>

- Interactivity is the key
- Include interactive sessions, e.g. Mentimeter, Group work, Quiz, Gamification

<h2> How should I structure my online training course?</h2>

- Start with an introduction and icebreaker
- Mixture between theoretical and interactive sessions
- Don’t forget breaks if your course is longer than 2h

<h2>In F2F meetings coffee breaks allow attendees to socialize. How can the socializing part be integrated into online courses?</h2>

- Gamification could be here quite usable
- “Online Social Event” during longer online course, e.g. Escape Room Game

<h2>How supportive can technical equipment be (e.g. using a Blue Screen)?</h2>

- Depends on the course format and our teaching style

<h2>How to use breakout rooms effectively?</h2>

- For group work (e.g. Group more than 10)
- When similar or different topics should be discussed

<h2>What are the best tools to get feedback from participants?</h2>

- SurveyMonkey
- LimeSurvey
- RSForm Pro

<h2>How to address technical issues during the course - losing audio/video? </h2>

- Stay cool! - This can happen
- Never teach alone - the second trainer should then act as host restart everything

<h2>How to keep the motivation among the participants throughout the course?</h2>

- Show them the benefit of the course
- Entertain participants ;)
- Good mixture between theoretical and hands ons parts - interaction
- Gamification

<h2>How to improve the bioinformatics training involving handson on tools and pipelines run through cloud and hpc cluster? </h2> 

- Check the de.NBI cloud
- Images are available for different courses
- Check usegalaxy.eu
- JupiterNotebook and R Studio are directly available for training purpose
- TAAS
