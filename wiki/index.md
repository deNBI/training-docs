# Training Clinic

The main objective of this new course format - Training Clinic - is to provide participants with new knowledge and skills in the field of training in order to conduct training courses more effectively and create better training material. We invite trainers and scientists interested in training to take part! The content of the training clinic is specifically designed for current and aspiring trainers seeking to enhance their expertise and effectiveness in their field.

The session also grants the possibility to exchange experiences between trainers and help connecting trainers. The course will be divided into different modules to facilitate the learning process. It will include a combination of lectures, practical exercises and case studies. This provides participants with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. However, the focus should be on the exchange of problem-solving treatments. 

In the fourth edition (14 February), we will explore "Feedback & Assessment in Training Courses." Uncover impactful strategies and tested methods to enhance the quality and effectiveness of your feedback processes. Whether you're an instructor or a participant, mastering feedback and assessment techniques can significantly elevate your training experience. Don't miss this opportunity to learn how to provide meaningful evaluations and optimize the learning journey in every session!
